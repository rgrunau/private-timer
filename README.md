## Why This Exists

Most fitness timer apps are bloated with ads, require accounts, track your data, or cost money for basic features. We built Private Timer because:

- **Your workout data should stay private** - No accounts, no cloud sync, no data mining
- **Simple tools should stay simple** - Timer apps don't need social features or premium subscriptions  
- **Offline should be the default** - Your gym doesn't always have WiFi
- **Free should mean free** - No hidden costs, premium tiers, or advertising

Private Timer proves you can have a beautiful, full-featured workout timer while respecting your privacy completely.
